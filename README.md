# covid19-gr-json
Daily reports from [EODY](https://eody.gov.gr) converted to json

## Original source
json files have been manually created based on PDF files distributed from
[EODY](https://eody.gr), e.g. https://eody.gov.gr/covid-gr-daily-report-20200323/
All the original pdfs for reports can be found at [EODY Daily reports](https://eody.gov.gr/epidimiologika-statistika-dedomena/imerisies-ektheseis-covid-19/)

## Data inconsistency
Reports from EODY don't have the same data nor the same format each day so
it's impossible to have consistency.

Examples of data that doesn't exist in every report:
- Details on hospitalized cases (age, gender)
- Hospitalized patients vs patients in IC
- Details per region
- Greeks vs non-Greeks
